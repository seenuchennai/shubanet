   ===================
    *) splitadjust: New tool added to supplement ms2asc tool, this tool
       can be used to split MS ascii data. Note this tool expects all
       the fields output by ms2asc tool, ie., --ignore<field> option of
       ms2asc should not be used with this tool. This tool will split
	   adjust on (primarykey) 'TICKER_SYMBOL', then on (secondarykey) 'Date'.
	   This tool does not support intra-day data.

       Usage: ms2asc -i<msdatadir> | perl ms2singleasc.pl | perl splitadjust.pl > splitadjsted.asc
              or
	      ms2asc -i<msdatadir> | perl ms2singleasc.pl | perl splitadjust.pl | asc2ms -o splitadjusted

       can be used to sort MS ascii data. Note this tool expects all
       the fields output by ms2asc tool, ie., --ignore<field> option of
       ms2asc should not be used with this tool. This tool will sort
       on (primarykey) 'TICKER_SYMBOL', then on (secondarykey) 'Date'
       then on (tertiarykey) 'TIME'.

       Usage: ms2asc -i<msdatadir> | perl sortmsdata > sortedfile.asc
              or
	      ms2asc -i<msdatadir> | perl sortmsdata | asc2ms -o sortedms

	      sortmsdata -iunsorteddata.asc -fsorteddata

    *) ms2singleasc: Added -o option to create new directories and
       -h option. Also need to make sure that this tool can only be
       used if tickers of the same type are grouped together, in other
       words it works fine with ms2asc's output.

    *) ms2singleasc: Added changes to replace '$' , '*' and ':' to 
       '_' from the ticker symbol

       [--ignoreTime=yes|no]
       [--ignoreOpen=yes|no]
       [--ignoreOpenInt=yes|no]

       These options could be used to ignore some fields from
       the output price data ascii file.

       The names themselves are self explanatory,
       If --ignoreTicker=yes is passed then ticker name will
       not be output in the price data file.

       By default they are all set to "no". That means all fields

    files. If old price data has open interest field, open interest
    field will not be ignored.

    *) asc2ms: Added new option to ignore "Open"
       field. [--ignoreOpen=yes|no]

    The default is --ignoreOpen=no.

    Note that this option only affects newly created price data
    files. If old price data has open field, open field will not
    be ignored.

    If "Open" is ignored, then "Open Interest" will also be ignored, this
    will happen even if explicitly --ignoreOpenInterest is set to yes.

    *) asc2ms: Optimized finding new record file numbers, this 
       avoids searching for duplicate records or holes if there
       are none.

    *) ms2asc: Fixed Bug: Open price output was not proper for
       6 field record.

    *) ms2asc: Removed a debug print getting printed.

   v1.5.14 Change Log: (Sun Jan 30 2005)
   ===================
    *) asc2ms: Added [--dopFiles=|-p yes|no] option.

    This option can be used to create F*.DOP Files.

    The default is --dopFiles=no.

    Note that this option only affects newly created price data
    files.  F*.DOP files for existing price data files are not
    affected.

   v1.5.13 Change Log: (Sat Jan 26 2005)
   ===================
    *) asc2ms: In case of traverseRecord option (-t), the tool
       now creates apart from A-Z directories 0-9 directories
       based on the first letter of the symbol, for any other
       character the ticker would be put under '^' directory.

    *) ms2asc: the headerline is now changed to use <DATE> instead
       of <DTYYYYMMDD>, it still outputs data in YYYYMMDD format.

    *) asc2ms: Fixed bugs related to missing data files, asc2ms
       now handles missing data files properly.

    *) asc2ms: Detects duplicate records in the master file,
       makes an attempt to reuse them if the symbol is different

   v1.5.10 Change Log: (Tue Jan 04 2005)
   ===================
    *) Fixed a bug <date> format was assuming date to be in
    <dd/mm/yyyy> whereas standard metastock usage is to expect
    in <mm/dd/yyyy> fixed this. If the date is in dd/mm/yyyy
    then <dtdd/mm/yyyy> could be used instead.
    
   v1.5.9 Change Log: (Sat Jan 01 2005)
   ==================
    *) Added support for header line field <dtmm/dd/yy>, <dtmm/dd/yyyy>

   v1.5.8 Change Log: (Fri Dec 31 2004)
   ==================
    *) asc2ms now supports updateRecord option if recordFile 
       exists.
       
       The option is:
 [--recordFileExist=|-r appendRecord|updateRecord|recordReplace|fileReplace]

       UpdateRecord option is useful if you need to update some price 
       data fields like name/open/high/low/close/volume/openinterest
       and at the same time you want to preserve other fields intact.

       Note: You cannot use this option to update ticker-symbol
             date and time fields, since these are used to identify
	     the record (record key fields).

   v1.5.7 Change Log: (Fri Dec 24 2004)
   ==================
    *) asc2ms and ms2asc now support priority levels.
       Supported priority levels are high/medium/low.

       This feature is useful to reduce load on the system
       when its used to convert data in bulk, in batch mode.

       The option is [--priorityLevel=|-l high|medium|low]

       If option is not specified then by default it is high.

   v1.5.6 Change Log: (Mon Dec 20 2004)
   ==================
    *) ms2asc now supports purging of zero volume data,
       a new option [--purgeZeroVol|-p] has been introduced
       to achieve the same.

    *) ms2asc now supports selective price data output,
       it supports the following options:
       [--symbolContains=|-s <ticker_symbol>]
       [--nameContains=|-n <ticker_name>]
       [--printFromDate=|-d <date>]
       [--printUptoDate=|-u <date>]

       For example, if --symbolContains="INTC" is passed, then
       all symbols containing the words "INTC" will be output
       into the ascii file.

       Similarly, if --nameContains="Intel" is passed, then all
       ticker names containing the words "Intel" will be output
       into the ascii file.

       Note: the letters are not case sensitive so "INTC" and "intc"
       both are equivalent.

       If --printDateFrom="27-Apr-1975" is passed, then all 
       symbols with dates greater than or equal to the above date
       will be output into the ascii file.

       If --printDateUpto="27-Apr-1975" is passed, then all 
       symbols with dates less than or equal to the above date
       will be output into the ascii file.

       Note: The date format could be any of the supported date
       formats, for ex: "19750427", "27/04/1975", "750427" etc.,

    *) asc2ms has a bug fix in ticker name. Ticker name was
       being written same as ticker symbol, fixed it.

   v1.5.5 Change Log: (Wed Dec 15 2004)
   ==================
    *) asc2ms now supports [--reverseOrder|-b] option.
    If this option is enabled, then the data is read from
    last line first. This option is useful to convert Yahoo!
    price data, which is stored as latest price first format.

   v1.5.4 Change Log: (Fri Dec 10 2004)
   ==================
    *) asc2ms now generates EMASTER file along with MASTER file.

   v1.5.3 Change Log: (Sun Dec  5 2004)
   ==================
    *) Implemented the following header line format:

 DateTime,Open,High,Low,Close,VAvg,Qty,Value,Trades,OpenInt,Cnt

       DateTime field is just a time format field
       in the following "03:50:25 p" or "10:50:25 a" 
       format.

       VAvg, Value, Trades are ignored.

       Note this is an intraday tick data format, since
       date is the same for all the prices.

    *) Now empty fields are recognized, and treated as such.

    *) Header fields "Cnt" or "Index" is now used to 
       sort based on the index.

    *) date field can now be specified on the command line.
       --date="05-Dec-2004",  -d "05-Dec-2004", -d "05/12/2004",
       -d "20041205" etc., are valid date field formats.

   v1.5.2 Change Log: (Sat Nov 13 2004)
   ==================
    *) Implemented the following header line format

        Index,Date Time,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume

        Here 'Index' field is ignored, and is as good
        as XX field. Date and Time could be in any of the
        below mentioned formats.

        Date: mmddyy, mmddyyyy, dd/mm/yy, dd/mm/yyyy, dd-mm-yy
        Time: hh:mm:ttt, hh:mm:ss, hhmm, hhmmss, hhmmttt etc.,

        This header line format is useful for those who use
        exported csv file from IndiaBulls website.

   v1.5.1 Change Log: (Sat Nov 6 2004)
   ==================
    *) Implemented ignoring of unused or dontcare fields
       which can be represented by XX in the header line.
       like <symbol>,<xx>,<per>,<open>,<high>,<low> ...
       or   <symbol>,XX,<per>,<open> etc.,

    *) Now NSE (National Stock Exchange of India) bhav copy
       *.csv format, can be directly converted to Metastock format.
       Bhav copy csv format is as below:

 SYMBOL,SERIES,OPEN,HIGH,LOW,CLOSE,LAST,PREVCLOSE,TOTTRDQTY,TOTTRDVAL,TIMESTAMP,   
      So the above header line format is now supported, where:
      SERIES, LAST, PREVCLOSE, TOTTRDVAL fields are ignored presently
      
      In case you need to use LAST instead of exchange adjusted close price
      CLOSE then you could rename LAST to CLOSE and rename CLOSE to XX
      to ignore the same.
